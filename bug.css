The following CSS code snippet intends to style a list, but it doesn't work as expected due to a typo in the selector:

```css
.list-items { /* Incorrect selector */
  list-style-type: none;
  padding: 0;
}

<ul class="list-item">
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
```

The typo is in the class name used in the CSS selector, it should be `list-item` instead of `list-items`.
