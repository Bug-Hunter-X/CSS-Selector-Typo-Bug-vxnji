This repository demonstrates a common CSS bug: a simple typo in a class selector that prevents styles from being applied.  The `bug.css` file contains the incorrect CSS, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version. This is a great example of how even minor errors can significantly impact the appearance of a webpage. Understanding how to effectively debug CSS issues is crucial for all front-end developers.
